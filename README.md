Hi everyone, I’m Abhas Chaudhari from Ghaziabad. I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science from KIET Group of Institutions, and I’ve always been interested in technology and problem-solving, which naturally pushed me toward pursuing a career in IT. Moving forward, after onboarding at Capgemini, I underwent a 2-month training on Big Data and Scala. During the training, we worked with technologies like Spark, Hadoop, and SQL, and toward the end we had a sprint project where we developed a complete solution using the concepts and tools we learned. It really helped me understand how to apply these technologies in a real development scenario. Lastly, I’m a quick learner and enjoy working collaboratively in a team environment, and I believe these qualities will help me contribute effectively to upcoming projects.

Tell me about a time you identified an improvement area instead of just completing the assigned work.

S — Situation:
Initially, the scope of the sprint project was only to identify overcrowded routes.

T — Task:
While working on it, I noticed that the same data could also highlight underutilized routes and potential optimization areas.

A — Action:
I proposed including additional metrics such as passenger-seat ratio, off-peak vs. peak utilization, and frequency-to-demand mapping. I added these calculations to the ETL transformations.

R — Result:
The dashboard provided richer insights that could support decision-making beyond overcrowded routes. The team appreciated the initiative, and it added significant value to the project.
